# QuietDriver Project

## Overview

The **QuietDriver Controller** is an enhancement of the traditional fixed time-gap model, aiming to provide smoother and more responsive vehicle-following dynamics in simulations.

## Key Features

- **Smooth Speed Transitions**: The ego car maintains a stable speed profile, even with fluctuations in the lead car's velocity.
- **Enhanced Safety**: In scenarios with large speed differences, the controller reduces abrupt changes in the ego car's speed, creating a safer and more comfortable driving experience.
- **Phantom Jam Mitigation**: Our controller has preliminarily solved the Phantom Jam problem, reducing the occurrence of traffic jams without an obvious cause.
